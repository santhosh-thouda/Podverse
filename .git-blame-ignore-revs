# This file helps clean up your git blame and other inline git tooling to ignore particular commits
# this is primarily used for ignoring large commits done via tooling (such as linting or codemod tools)
# that have a tendency to touch a large portion of the codebase without changing the logic or otherwise
# function of the code.
#
# This should be enabled on each developer machine by running
#
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# while in the root of this repo
